# 🎣 Lazy Lake

Welcome to **Lazy Lake** — a fun twist on the classic **brick-breaker** game, themed around **fishing on a peaceful lake**!  
Instead of smashing bricks, you're casting your hook to catch **all 33 fish** while navigating across a relaxing water scene.

---

## 🕹 Game Concept

- **Goal**: Catch **all the fish** swimming in the lake by bouncing your fishing hook (ball) off your boat (paddle).
- **Theme**: A relaxing fishing day on a calm lake.
- **Twist**: Instead of bricks, you’re breaking through **fish sprites**.  
- **Challenge**: Don't let the hook fall into the lake — keep bouncing it off your boat!

2. Move your boat left and right using **keyboard arrows** or **dragging with the mouse**.
